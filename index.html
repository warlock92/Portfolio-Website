					<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my profile. A small bio about myself:</p>

					<p>I am an graduate from IIT Madras with specializations in Electrical Power Systems and Construction Management domains. I have experience in various Automotive, Power systems and electrical distribution systems by working in both academic and industrial Projects sponsored by companies such as Larsen and Toubro, Lockheed Martin Corporation. My patent(pending) project on the topic "Non-Solenoidal Operation of Starter Motors" in automotive electrical domain was self-prototyped and industrially tested at Lucas TVS as part of my Bachelor's thesis. My Master thesis was related to Power Quality in Metro Traction Distribution Systems at IIT Madras, on the topic "Harmonic Analysis and Mitigation for Metro Rail Power Distribution System".</p>


					<p>I am a self-motivated, hard-working individual who strongly believes that success is a journey which can be conquered with core hard-work blended with the courage to learn from mistakes. I have a penchant for going an extra mile to wade through the minute details and expand my skills by mastering offbeat areas which are out of my comfort zone. I constantly keep updating myself through MOOC's be it in Supply chain or Analytics or Computer Science. Always on the lookout to work on Interdisciplinary projects.</p>


					<p>I welcome all calls and e-mails. You can reach me at: E-mail: dbin25@gmail.com </p>
